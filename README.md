KillStroke
==========

Minimal Windows application which can kill hanging programs (especially games).

Sometimes a program is hanging and its window is blocking the view to the Desktop. It's almost impossible to use the Windows Task Manager in this case. This application provides a shortcut key which kill such programs and grant access to the Desktop again.

The short cut is: **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K** (for kill)

This application has no User Interface, just put it in your Startup folder and use it when needed. It uses almost zero system resources.

Future improvements
-------------------

* Configurable shortcut key
* Work with elevated processes (KillStroke cannot kill elevated programs yet)
